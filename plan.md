# Where2Test Plan #

1. How will you coordinate your work?  
* Who will coordinate the work?  
    * *Project Manager*
* What will their project management practices be?  
    * *Check-ins on Sundays | Tuesdays | Fridays*
* Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas?  
    * *We will meet during class times and if needed on Sundays at 11am*  
        * *If sundays aren’t available we can do saturday as well*  
        * *Will double check which days are available the wednesday before said meeting*  
    * *The PM will plan these meeting agendas*  

As it is the project manager’s job to coordinate with the team, we decided to have the project manager manage all of the meetings and agendas. The project manager will conduct the check-ins in order to make sure the team is on the right track which will hopefully lessen the burden of everyone on the team!  

2. What tools will you use to communicate?  
* For each, articulate the alternatives and why that is the best choice.  
    * *Discord : Private Chat*  
        * *We created our own private chat for Team Doctors where we generally communicate about homework and upcoming due dates*  
    * *Discord : INFO 442 Server*  
        * *If for some reason, discord only works for servers, we can also call in “Team Doctors” voice room and chat room*  
    * *Zoom*  
        * *If Discord fails, the project manager will provide a Zoom link where we can meet up and work on the project!*  

We chose to use discord as our main mode of communication because it is the easiest application to use in our opinion. Discord allows us to have everything in one area as our classroom is also via Discord. We are able to voice call and screen share which makes working together much more seamless. However the possibility of Discord failing is not impossible, so our backup application to use would be Zoom. We are all familiar with Zoom so the transition between Discord and Zoom would not be difficult at all.   

3. Who will own components in your architecture?  
* Owning them means being responsible for writing them and making sure they are functional and correct.  
* For each component, list the one person who is in charge of getting it done.
    * *SurveyController*  
        * *Vivian (Developer)*  
    * *SurveyModel*   
        * *Rani (PM)*   
    * *TestingCenterModel*  
        * *Rani (PM)*  
    * *SurveyView*  
        * *Izzy (Designer)*  
    * *ResultsView*  
        * *Izzy (Designer)*  

We decided to our developer ownership of the controller because she has experience with controllers and experience developing web applications. We also decided  to have our designer have ownership over the views because the views will require the design of the mockups that our designer made. Lastly, we decided to have our PM have ownership over the models because we wanted to make sure the work was evenly distributed.  

4. What is your timeline?
* Include a list of milestones you'll reach and deadlines for each.  
    1. *UI (NOVEMBER 13th | FRIDAY)*  
        * *Landing page is complete*  
        * *Questions are available*  
        * *All buttons are there*  
        * *Doesn’t have to be perfect, as long as it’s there*
    2. *MVP (NOVEMBER 27th | FRIDAY)*  
        * *Minimum Viable Product*  
        * *Components: Controller, Views and Models should be ready*  
        * *Backend details should be completed*  
        * *Data is ready to go | available for use*  
    3. *BREAK! :D*  
    4. *BREAK IT! (NOVEMBER 30th | MONDAY)*  
        * *Application should be close to completion*  
        * *Testers will use the application as normal and find any defects or failures and we will fix as needed*  
        * *Verification Plan will be done/completed on this day!*   
    5. *COMPLETION DATE (DECEMBER 4th | FRIDAY)*  
        * *Application is complete and ready for the launch party!!*  
    6. *LAUNCH PARTY (DECEMBER 9th | WEDNESDAY)*  
        * *Time to break applications!*  

We have a more ambitious timeline.  We want to get an early start which is why we want the UI done at the end of next week.  We think it is possible to get an MVP done the week after that, so we can start fixing and editing the UI early, as well as testing early.  After we have a complete app, we will try to break it ourselves.  We want to improve and finalize our app without a rush before the launch party.  

5. How will you verify that you've met your requirements?  
**All of our requirements listed below will be verified manually**

We chose to do manual testing because we have a lot of visual components which makes it easy to check if they render correctly or not.  It is also beneficial for our project specifically because our webapp has one to two simple inputs for each rendered page which makes it easy to manually systematically check everything is going the way we want it to.  We also think manual testing would be more beneficial than automated testing because of our simplistic design.  We can really take it step by step and watch what is going on in the front-end as well as the back-end.  Our plan is to verify as we build each component. Commit very often when working on a function or small module. Verify and then push every time you get a function or small module working for each component.At the very end, we plan to do a complete re-verification to make sure that our system works once all integrated together.
