Mission Statement: Equal opportunity and accessibility to COVID-19 testing and resources

Problem Statement: Just a few months ago, COVID-19 tests were sparse. Now, with more materials, more testing, and a funded study on UWâ€™s campus, people are urged to get tested more frequently. If people do not utilize these testing centers and tests that are available, we will not be able to contain and track the spread of COVID-19, resulting in a high number of COVID-19 deaths. Currently, Google gives a list of COVID-19 testing centers with only a limited amount of information. There are many factors that impede a person from getting tested such as difficulties finding and getting to testing centers that are heightened by disparities in accessibility between income levels. While this problem is an issue nationwide, and even worldwide, we narrow our scope to UW and the areas around it, choosing to focus closely on the issue of accessibility in low income communities.
