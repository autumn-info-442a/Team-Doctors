Mission Statement: Equal opportunity and accessibility to COVID-19 testing and resources

Problem Statement: Currently, people around Seattle are frequently encouraged to get tested for COVID-19, however, it is not always easy to find a testing center that fits all of your needs and/or preferences. When you search up ‘COVID-19 testing centers near me’, Google provides a list of testing centers solely based on proximity with general and vague information. However, there are many other important factors that may determine where one chooses to get tested, such as the availability of drive-through testing, operational hours, and the need for a translator, just to name a few. Currently, a person would need to navigate through multiple platforms to find out all of this information, which can be a confusing and time-consuming process.
