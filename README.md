Mission Statement: Equal opportunity and accessibility to COVID-19 testing and resources

Problem Statement: Currently, people around Seattle are encouraged to get tested for COVID-19, however, it is not completely an equitable process to get tested. Google provides a list of COVID-19 testing centers with broad information such as whether it is drive through and whether you need an appointment. However, there are many factors that disproportionately impact low income and minority communities from getting tested such as insurance, price, and language barriers. By decreasing inequity in COVID-19 testing accessibility, we can help contain the spread of COVID-19 in low income and minority communities.
